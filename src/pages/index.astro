        wrong? The answer turns out to be not what I typed wrong or left out,

      For the most part, computers and apostrophes have never become fast
      friends. It’s a spotty situation. Online programs seem to have no trouble
      in accepting apostrophes when they are doing their two main assignments:
      subbing for omitted letters, as in “can’t” for “cannot,” or indicating
      possession, like “Where is the dog’s water bowl?” But come to being used
      in Irish names it’s game over. My little mark is treated as an
      unacceptable, non-conforming “foreign element.” Grrr.

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      Out of this frustration, and the sense that we were not alone, was born
      the idea to form the Keep the Apostrophe in Irish Names advocacy group
      along with my son Matt O&#39;Leary.

      What’s in a name? Our ethnic history
    </h4>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      From ancient times, the Irish developed a complex personal naming system,
      based largely on a family’s history and relationships. Names consist of a
      first given name followed by a double patronym, using the father’s and
      grandfather’s names. An O with a small dash at the middle top (called a
      diacritical mark) meant “descended from” or “grandson” or “son of,”
      followed by the surname. “Mac” and “Fitz” serve the same purpose. Even
      though some Irish names are based on occupations and locations, family
      connections have always been more important and more commonly used for
      many centuries.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      The Irish Times reports that when the death of Tigherneach Ó Cleirigh, a
      prominent lord of County Galway, was inscribed in the 916 Annals it was
      believed to be the oldest surname recorded anywhere in Europe. With more
      English influence felt around 1500 A.D. the Irish spelling of names was
      often changed to an English spelling using O with an apostrophe to stand
      in for the earlier Ó and its diacritical mark on top.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      All of this rich history is threatened by the likes of a movement called
      Kill the Apostrophe. Its website states that it wants to remove the mark
      from the English language because “it serves only to annoy those who know
      how it is supposed to be used and to confuse those who dont (sic).” Of
      course, the website is concerned about the apostrophe’s use to fill in for
      omitted letters and its possessive duties, but if the mark is dropped from
      common usage (Starbucks and Hudsons Bay for instance) it will also
      disappear from computer keyboards, wiping out a vital part of the Irish
      naming system and the valuable cultural history it represents.

      A rich history ignored
    </h4>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      Obviously, there are folks out there in the commercial world who are
      either indifferent to this important feature in Irish names, or actually
      determined to do away with it. They belong to the same bunch who think
      teaching cursive writing in elementary school “takes too much time.” (Who
      needs to know how to read the original Declaration of Independence, sign
      their name, or read their grandmother&#39;s hand written letters? And who
      needs beautifully executed calligraphy anyway?)
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      Scripturient writer Ian Chadwick muses on the possible dropping of
      apostrophes: “Can you imagine what the Irish would do if they had no
      apostrophes? Would we write Obrien or OBrien or use a dash for O-Brien.
      One incorrect “solution,” which pops up regularly, is to simply pass the O
      off as your middle initial. Meanwhile, a few computer programs have
      figured out seemingly clumsy ways to deal with apostrophes. A printed
      version of my name can sometimes appear as O&#x27;Leary. This morning it
      was O&#039;Leary on a car loan site.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 sm:text-lg mb-4">
      A major bank that I attend regularly cannot accommodate my name being
      spelled correctly in its master files or on my credit card. The best the
      bank can do is print my last name correctly for my checkbook checks. A
      leading airline has me correctly in older files, but once it merged with a
      smaller line the apostrophe got dropped. The only way I can make a
      reservation is to telephone and asked not to be slapped with a special fee
      to book over the phone since the system has me in two conflicting versions
      that won’t accept me on line. Also, there is the worry that you’ll have
      problems with tight security at airport checkin, where a name on your
      ticket has to exactly match your ID documents.

      I have a hunch that if robot computers had their way, we Irish and
      everybody else would be identified with numbers, or even worse with a
      quick scanning of our bar codes.

      Yes, it&#39;s possible. Information Technology specialists can develop
      code level checks, by writing a few more lines of code, to allow the usage
      of this character in name field data entry points of user interfaces
      (mobile, web, etc.).

      There are potential security implications. Computer Programmers and
      Information Security advisors aim to decrease the attack surface and
      strengthen the attack vectors in the systems that they develop. This is
      important for keeping systems safe from attackers. It’s common practice to
      decrease the opportunity for an end user to enter special characters such
      as (? | | &quot; | % | \ | / | : | ‘ * | Due to their usage in popular
      programming languages like C, C++, PHP, C#, SQL, and Java many of these
      characters can trigger code execution in Information Systems if not
      handled correctly in the code. Although the intention of Computer
      Programmers and Information Security advisors is beneficial for end user
      safety, it is unfair to ask individuals to skip the apostrophe in their
      names due to this reason. With a little bit more work on code level checks
      this character can be allowed for use. Apostrophes in names have cultural
      value and help to make them unique in an artistic way. This character
      should be accommodated for names in software systems.
